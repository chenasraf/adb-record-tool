# record-adb

A simple, scriptable workflow for recording, pulling, and compressing Android screen recordings
using ADB.

## Features

- âœ… Record Android screen using `adb shell screenrecord`
- âœ… Manual stop via Ctrl+C without corrupting the output
- âœ… Automatically remembers your recording parameters
- âœ… Finalize: Pull and delete the recording from the device
- âœ… Compress recorded videos using `ffmpeg`

## Usage

### 1. Start Recording

```bash
./record-adb.sh record [--size <num>] [--output <name>]
```

- `--size`: Target resolution (e.g. `300` becomes `300x300`)
- `--output`: Base filename (default: `screencast`)

> ðŸ“Œ Press `Ctrl+C` when you're done recording
>
> ðŸ“Œ If resolution is omitted, it will be the detected screen size from the device

### 2. Finalize Recording

```bash
./record-adb.sh finalize
```

- Pulls the video from your device
- Deletes the remote file
- Uses the parameters saved from the `record` step

### 3. Compress Recording

```bash
./record-adb.sh compress [--output <name>]
```

- Compresses `<name>.mp4` into `<name>_compressed.mp4`
- If no name is provided, it uses the last recorded filename

## Examples

```bash
# Record a 480x480 video named "demo"
./record-adb.sh record --size 480 --output demo

# After Ctrl+C, finalize it
./record-adb.sh finalize

# Compress it
./record-adb.sh compress
```

## Requirements

- `adb` (Android Debug Bridge)
- `ffmpeg` (for compression)
